Notes for methods:

target variables
predictor variables
binary classification


Notes:
Justify why use salinity and temperature as predictor variables (also time)

- correlation between variables? (salt/temp)
	- pearson correlation 

Need some validation trainng data (70-30)

Cross Validation
divde data into folds

Tomorrow's plan


- experiemnt with bigger training box
- write up known patterns detected in analysis
- make anomaly plots with discriminate score (or find another way to reveal spatial variability)
- make training variability plot
- calculate dominance periods (sequence plot) (gradient?) like state sequence plot for HMMs **
- assess the above in detail (i.e. what month is the pattern)
- correlation with weather data? (outside of seasonal pattern) (i.e. rain could be significant)
- correlation with chl-a?
- comparisons with gemmas paper (SST)
- 


done
- make monthly averaged stack diagrams
