Discussion points

- Increase in EAC fraction and dominance
- ENSO cycle overlaying intensification
- It's noteworthy that we picked up an increasing EAC signal at this timescale
- Increase for coastal and regional areas equivalent in magnitude
- Is the observed seasonality pattern different to other regions?
- Seasonal plots - time lag in EAC influence for region (discussion note - due to bass strait influence pushing it offshore?)
- Model performance and validation?
- Problems with not being able to properly validate data
- Sensitiveity to only two current type (improve through using different statistical modesl. )
- Relate my metrics to indpendent asswsments of EAC intensification
- Alastair Hobdayâ€™s papers re: EAC implications for marine ecosystems/fisheries 
- Discuss the problems with using just surface layers

Discussion structure

- Reiterate most important results
- Intensification discuss trends in magnitude and duration, difference between study zones and also discuss in the context of the literature. Was cool we picked up the known trends
- same
- Overlaying ENSO signaln
- Seasonal cyclic pattern and variation over time and between study zones. 
- Ecological consequences of these petterns
- same
- Variation path to the south (stable to north)
	- Penguins go here :)
- Performance of algorithm
	- Ability to distinguish complesx spatial patterns of T and S. 
	- Identified known trends in the literature
- further investigation and extensions
- issues and improvements ^ overlap with above
- conclusions


TODO

- Better justify choice of methods over alternatives


Ecology discussion 
% Examples: 
1) Little penguins breeding season foraging (central place foragers). Other birds also as examples. Birds sensitive to change (Gemma - sci reports) 
2) Forage fish - These species feed on phytoplankton and zooplankton, the abundance and distribution of which are tightly linked to nutrient upwelling in boundary current systems
3) EAC surface flooding causing cold water upwellings  

Structure, 
Chainging in seasonal timing and surface flooding leading to additional upwelling. 
Lead to chnages in the timing of the spring bloom and the assemblages of zoo and phyto plankton. 
Lead to chnages in the community assembkages of pelagic fishes and modification of the prey field, give exmaples. 
Lead to chnages in the behaviour and habitat utilisation of mesopredators such athe little penguin and other central place bird species.
